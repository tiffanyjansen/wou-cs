        <h3>About the Assignment</h3>
        <p>
            When first looking at the assigment I was really scared it was going to take a super long 
            time, but once I got started everything kind of started falling into place. The assignment 
            asked us to create a simple webpage using Git, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap-4. At first I didn't think
            I knew anything about any of it, but once I started looking I realized I had used HTML and CSS 
            a little over the summer when I was trying to prepare myself for this class (I guess it kind of 
            worked...). The parts that confused me the most were the Git and Bootstrap-4 parts just because 
            I hadn't really heard of them and I didn't really understand what they did. Lucky for me I have
            lots of friends in the class and one of them was kind enough to explain how to get Git set up once 
            I had it downloaded. Once I got that going it seemed pretty easy because the rest of the assignment used 
            HTML and CSS and I knew the basics of those. Another issue I had was with Bootstrap-4 becuase I didn't realize 
            it needed to be added to the repository (the place where all the code is), but once I got that done the rest fell
            into place easily. There is a lot of documentation for Bootstrap making it super easy to learn in a short
            amount of time.

                    <h3>Step 1: Download Git and Create a GitHub</h3>
                    <p>
                        I downloaded git before I made my GitHub, but I didn't do anything with it since, at the time, I didn't 
                        really know what to do with it. I made my GitHub and made a repository on the site because when I was looking 
                        at the examples that Dr. Morse gave us, they all said that was the easiest way to get the stuff set up. Once I did 
                        that I cloned it by opening up the Git Bash I had downloaded when I downloaded Git (seen to the right). After cloning 
                        it I moved my directory so I was in the folder. Then I checked the status because that's what I was told to do. Then I 
                        was done with this step! Woo!!

                    <h3>Step 2: Plan the Webpage</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I first started this project I had no idea what I was going to do, so I drew some pictures and 
                        tried to turn those into a "reality." The sketches are really bad, so don't judge, but they are on the left and below. 
                        I miss my cats from home and my new apartment won't let me have one so I decided to do my website about cats. 
                        I decided on the random stuff I did because of all the requirements, but I used Bootstrap-4 on every page whether
                        the page was one column or 2. I tried doing a 3-column page, but all the pictures I found were too big and it looked 
                        kind of stupid, so I just stuck to the 2 column one. Since I already knew a lot of HTML and CSS the rest wasn't too hard 
                        once I had a plan. I ended up looking up some stuff, but I already knew most of it. The link for the webpage I created 
                        can be found <a href="HW1/page1.html">here</a>. The page is cute and everything but it's no where near perfect. If I could I 
                        would keep working on it forever, but of course I can't because I have 4 other classes and the next assigment in this class 
                        is due in a little over a week, so I should just stop while I am ahead. Anyway, this was the plan.

                        <h3>Step 3: Build the Webpage</h3>
                        <p>
                            The next step was to build the site. At first it didn't seem to like me, but once I got into the groove of things 
                            it actually went really smoothly. When I first started I thought I had to commit to see any changes so that's why 
                            I have a ton of commits when I first started my site. One of the things I had the biggest issue with was the Bootstrap-4 
                            stuff just because I didn't really know what it was supposed to do. The other thing is for some reason the code didn't like 
                            to change the background when I wanted it to, so Dominic looked at it and made it so it would work. Another issue I had was coming 
                            up with ideas for all the requirements. The requirements are:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Use Bootstrap-4 for layouts</li>
                                <li>Have a Seperate CSS File for Styling</li>
                                <li>Navigation Bar</li>
                                <li>At least one table</li>
                                <li>Two kinds of lists</li>
                                <li>Consistent styling</li>
                                <li>Don't cheat</li>
                            </ol>
                            The requirements made sense, I just had to make them work with my site. Once I figured out Bootstrap-4 it wasn't too bad, and the 
                            seperate file actually made the code look nicer. The navigation bar was a problem for a while. I ended up doing a lot of Googling. I found 
                            the code and realized how easy it actually was, but just trying to come up with it on your own didn't seem very fun (code can be found to the right). The table wasn't 
                            too bad to code since I had done it once over the summer. I just needed to find something that would work that (hopefully) made sense with the 
                            rest of the site. The lists weren't too bad either, but I will still show you the code below. Now, the styling I did all by myself, but I did 
                            a lot of copy and pasting of the navigation bar and making sure the pages all looked similar. The only one that doesn't is the one filled with pictures 
                            because I didn't like how the borders looked on them. I didn't cheat either, in the way that it says not to on the homework. Google was defnitely 
                            a good friend on this assignment, but I didn't use anything like Dreamweaver. I did all of it by myself (and I did a pretty good job, I think...).

                        <h3>Step 4: Testing</h3>
                        <p>
                            This was my favorite part. I got to show my roommate and friends my cool website and let them play around with it. I also 
                            cloned it again and made sure it worked, it does! I did a lot of testing as I went, so the testing part wasn't that big of a deal 
                            at the end. I am a perfectionist some times, which is going to be really bad come next term, but that's okay. It took me a while to figure 
                            out exactly how I wanted everything, but now that I am done I am super proud of my work and I think it's good enough to turn in.

        <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
        <p>
            Well, that was my wonderful blog, the rest of the assignment included making this, and the portfolio (the opening page, I think...). So, now 
            that I am done I just wanted to say thank you for looking over this. I spent a lot of hours doing it and I am super proud of where it turned up. 
            The beginning was a struggle, but now that I know more HTML and Git and everything I feel ready for the next assignment.
