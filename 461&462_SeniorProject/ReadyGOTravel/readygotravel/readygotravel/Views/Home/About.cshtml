                <p id="about">
                    I originally I wanted to be a high school math teacher. I was required to take a CS class and found that it was kind of fun, but I think it was the second CS class I took that really sealed it for me. I was dreaming about making the code do what I wanted it to, and it just made me realize that the problems in Computer Science are closely related to the problems in Mathematics and I decided that CS would be a better fit for me.

                <h6>What do you aspire to do after college?</h6>
                <p id="about">
                    I would like to do something that challenges me. I want to have to think about problems and try to fix them. I would love to have a job making algorithms or doing something mathematical, but I also really enjoy doing Software Engineering too. Honestly, I don’t know EXACTLY what I want to do, but I think it would be super fun to use my degree to do something with Computers that helps someone somewhere. I want to make a difference. I keep thinking about going to get my PhD and becoming a professor of Computer Science… I don’t know. I just have so many options that it’s hard to choose.

                <h6>What do you like most about traveling?</h6>
                <p id="about">
                    I don’t usually travel. I have only been on 2 round-trip flights in my life, so I don’t have a lot of experience, but what I do like is the feeling of being free. When I travel, I have none of the responsibilities that I have when I’m home. I get to do what I want. I think seeing all the sights and seeing the people and comparing it to home is cool too.

                    I always loved troubleshooting and building my own computers growing up.  I figured it would be great to learn more about how computers worked at a software as well as hardware level.  Then I could do something I loved and turn it into a potential profession.

                    Software design, or database administration sounds very appealing.  I love working with Databases and I am fascinated with storing and managing large sets of data.

                <p id="about">
                    Knowing that there is always somewhere new to go and something new to see.  I also love the freedom of it, how you feel when you go somewhere else while stepping outside of the normal day to day grind of work/school.  You get to be somewhere/someone else for a while and simply enjoy what you worked and saved up for.

                    New Zealand because it has so many sites and wildlife that are so very different from most places in the world.  You get to see a variety of climate and landscapes that are very unique.  Not to mention all of the locations you could visit that have been used in multiple movies.

                <p id="about">
                    The main reason was because I found the first computer science class I ever took to be really fun and easy. I was first introduced to computer science in my senior year in high school when I took a computer science class. I didn't have much interest in it at first, especially since it was my backup choice as an elective and I was disappointed at not getting my first choice. After some time I eventually found it to be my most enjoyable class. At the time I didn’t think about making it my future field of study but as college came around I decided to just stick with what I liked which was computer science.

                    I will hopefully get a decent job and make some decent money. I'm not exactly sure what kind of job I want but probably something related to software development. Gaining some experience is my main focus.

                <p id="about">
                    I feel like I'm probably one of the worst people you can ask this question to since I don't really travel at all. The only place I have traveled to was California when I was five or six.

                <h6>What would your dream destination be and why?</h6>
                <p id="about">
                    I don't really think about traveling anywhere but if I had to choose somewhere then probably France. I took 4 years of French in high school and it would be cool if I could actually use it for something. Maybe then I could also re-learn most of the language since I probably forgot about 75% of it.

                    I decided to study computer science because I have been an avid computer user since I was 11 years old and my dad has worked and taught in this field my entire life. I kind of started on a whim after pursuing other career venues, and I’ve fallen deep in love with the problem solving aspect of coding.

                    The best part of travelling is experiencing other cultures, cuisine, and climate. I have travelled to various places both in and outside of the United States and I never want to stop. It’s such an important experience for personal growth.
