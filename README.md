## CS 162 Labs
These labs were done in Spring of 2017. Since I was taking another class during the time of the labs, I had to do all the labs by myself. Except Lab 8. Lab 8 was done using Pair Programming with Stacia Fry. The labs are very simple since it was just an intro class. It was done solely in Java using BlueJ as the IDE. 

## CS 260 Labs
These labs were done in Fall of 2017. I originally used Eclipse as my IDE so I had to dig really hard into the folders to get the code out of it. It's not all that great, but I hope it gets the point across that I have learned a lot since this class.

## CS 360 Labs
These labs were done in Winter of 2018. This class was my first class learning new languages besides Java, so it was a real eye-opener. Some of the code is really bad and super unorganized, but I was able to learn all the languages in a short time. This class was great because it taught me how to learn a new language fast. (It make CS 460 much easier.)
